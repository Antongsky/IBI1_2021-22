When talking about my hobby,
I love hiking, and taking photographs.
I'm a shutterbug, especially like shoting plants' and birds' photos.
Trying to identify wild plant species is also a enjoyable thing.
Except from that, I am also a Astronomy fan.
Bakering, playing piano, learning a new language and singing are my subordinate hobby.
