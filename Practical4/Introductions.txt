 Hello,
My name is Lin,Zhanyi. It's nice to be here, 
and I hope to make greatest memories here.
I'm a naturalist, so I always like to be with natture in my free time.
Coding is a nightmare for me when I heard it for the first time, but
not until last week did I found,
computer is actually our friend. It helps us to analysis statistics better
by dealing with big data that human's brain can't work on.

Actually, it helps us to learn the world better.
That's how I changed my mind and want to learn coding attentively.

...

Here begins the journey.
