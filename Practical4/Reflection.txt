Computer science learning diary

# 2022/3/8 
  This is my first day in git and github. Today I learnt how to use github to start a webpage. 
It is fantastic! I always wanted to make a webpage but din't know how to do it. So, today is actually a milestone.
  The practical today is actually difficult to complete-I spent nearly 8 hours on it. I had came up with many questions 
so I tried to ask my classmate. However, lots of them nither knoe how to fix the problem, so it takes a long time for 
me to work on them. After asking others and checking the Internet, finally I made it! I was so proud when correct words
finally appeared in the screen when I typeed in the URL.
  Hope I can keep working on my webpage, learn more to make it better!
