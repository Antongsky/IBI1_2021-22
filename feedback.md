Improvements I made after reading the feedback.

Week 4.
1. Reflection.txt was re-uploded to folder Practical4. Previously it was put in the wrong directory.
2. Commit messages were rewritten to be more informative. Such as "v2. Grammar mistakes corrected.", including the version and changes I made.

Week5.
1. In variable.py, "e is greater than d" was added to the comment, because I forgot to claim that e is greater than d.
2. In variable.py, two variables X and Y are used to store boolean variables, so I changed the to boolean value( first X=True Y=True, second X=True Y=False).
3. In mystery_code.py, comments "Each time a random number n is generated" was added. The random number is not generated at last, but in each step.

Week6.
1. The plots were re-labeled clearlyï¼Œincluding titles, xlabels and ylabels.
